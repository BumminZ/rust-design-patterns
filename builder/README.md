# Builder Pattern

## Description

This is one of the famous patterns of object oriented based design patterns.

### Pros

- Can construct objects step-by-step, can use recursion.
- Can reuse the same construction code.
- Depends on [_Single Responsibility Principle_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle).

### Cons

- The one downside of this pattern is that, the pattern requires creating multiple new classes.
